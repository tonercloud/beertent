The purpose of the app is to allow a user to maintain a list of all the beers they've consumed. It does it holding a list of breweries and their beers in a SQLite database.

The app was originally written for a Nokia N900 but is in the process of being ported to a Jolla phone running their Sailfish OS.

The code is a mixture of C++ and QML.
